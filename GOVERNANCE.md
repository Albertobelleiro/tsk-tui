# Governance

## Project Model

`tsk` is currently maintained under a maintainer-led model.

Maintainers are responsible for:

- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Release management
- Roadmap prioritization
- Security triage and incident response

## Decision-Making

General decision flow:

1. Discuss in issues/discussions
2. Prefer evidence-based, user-impact-driven decisions
3. Maintainers make the final decision when consensus is unclear

## Contribution Path

Contributors can earn broader trust and ownership by consistently delivering:

- High-quality pull requests
- Reliable review participation
- Positive community behavior

## Code Ownership

Code ownership is defined in [`.github/CODEOWNERS`](.github/CODEOWNERS).
