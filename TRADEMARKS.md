# Trademarks

`tsk` and associated logos are project marks.

Use of these marks must not create confusion about origin, sponsorship, or endorsement.

Permitted nominative use includes factual references such as:

- "Compatible with tsk"
- "Data exported from tsk"

Prohibited examples include:

- Using project marks as your product name
- Reusing logos in a way that implies official partnership
