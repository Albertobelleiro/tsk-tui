# Asset and Brand Usage

## Code vs Brand Assets

The software source code is licensed under the MIT License (see [`LICENSE`](LICENSE)).

Brand assets (including logos, product name marks, and visual identity files under `assets/logo/`) are **not automatically granted for unrestricted trademark use** by the MIT software license.

## Allowed Use

You may use repository assets for:

- Running and evaluating the project
- Contributing to this repository
- Referencing the project in documentation, tutorials, and integrations

## Restricted Use

Do not use project logos or brand identity in a way that implies official endorsement, affiliation, or authorship without permission.

For broader brand usage requests, contact the maintainers via GitHub.
